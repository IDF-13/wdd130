    <h2>Michael Braun</h2>
    <p>Currently investigating software development and/or government work professionally. Avid MTG player and cube curator. Voracious reader, mostly audiobooks nowadays. Currently single, and keeping it that way for the foreseeable future. Currently flipping burgers at McDonald's. I've been impressed with my schools' faculty, overall. Initially I took this web design class because it was required study, though I'm beginning to see potential implementations for my hobbies. I'm mostly hoping to gain as much experience as possible!</p>
    <p>I've been a member of my church as long as I can remember, and I'm most passionate about its' dedication to emphasize and implement love and care for the world. My profile art is done by Sleppu, it's the cover of one of my favorite Vocaloid artist's albums, '715'.</p>
